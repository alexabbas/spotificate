# spotificate
Tools for managing my Spotify through the R API (spotifyr).

Mostly this is motivated by a desire to curate my playlists, doing things like checking where I might have added the same song accidentally to multiple playlists and want to prune it back out. But there's a lot of other fun things that are possible.
